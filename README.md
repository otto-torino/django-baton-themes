# Django Baton Themes

This is a place which collects themes for [django-baton](https://github.com/abidibo/django-baton).

Baton provides a model managed in the admin which can contain css injected in the app. This the right place where you can override the css variables used by Baton. So in order to use a new theme you just need to create a new record and paste the provided css, than activate it.

Here the list of themes:

- [Tranquillity Light 1](./themes/tranquillity-light-1/README.md)
- [Tranquillity Light 2](./themes/tranquillity-light-2/README.md)

## Contribute

New themes idea are very much appreciated! Please submit your pull request to this repo. Just create a new folder and add a `README.md` file describing the theme and preferably including a screenshot. Then add the link in this file.
